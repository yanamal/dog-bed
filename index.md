# Animal Donut Dog Bed Tutorial

Or, if that sequence of nouns is too hard to parse, a tutorial for making a bed for dogs which is both donut-shaped and also resembles an animal.

This bed has two zippers so you can take out the three internal cushions and wash the outer shell!

## Materials

  &#9312; About 3 yars of **lining fabric** - This fabric will be used inside the bed for the three removable cushions that contain all the stuffing.

  I use whatever inexpensive stretchy fabric I can find.
  
  I think using stretchy fabric here helps achieve the "overstuffed" look for the bed. When the lining fabric stretches, the stuffing is then less constricted by it, and still has a chance to push directly against the outside of the bed.

  I like it when the fabric has a woven-in or knitted-in striped or rectangular pattern, like the fabric I used in this case. It's a super helpful shortcut for measuring and cutting the right shape, since I can just cut along the stripe! Especially when I'm trying to cut out really big rectangular pieces in super stretchy fabric which is really hard to measure consistently as it stretches!

  &#9313; About 3 yards of **fabric for the main bed surface**
  
  &#9314; About 1 yard of **non-slip fabric for bottom of the bed**
  
  &#9315; One really long **separating zipper** (around 100-110 inches long)
  
  &#9316; One **shorter zipper** - at least 24 inches long, and it doesn't have to be a separating zipper.
  
  &#9317; **Fiber fill** (stuffing) - I think I ended up using a bit over 5 lbs of fiber fill on this bed
  
  &#9318; (Optional?) A 36x24 piece of **high-density cushion foam**, 1 inch thick
  
  &#9319; (Highly optional) **A "helpful" puppy** who really wants to be involved
  
  &#9320; (Not pictured) Additional odds and ends for the animal face - this really just depends on what animal you are making and how you want to make it!
