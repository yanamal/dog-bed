This bed has two zippers so you can take out the three internal cushions and wash the outer shell!

  &#9312; About 3 yards of **lining fabric** - This fabric will be used inside the bed for the three removable cushions that contain all the stuffing.
  
  </summary>

  I use whatever inexpensive stretchy fabric I can find.
  
  I think using stretchy fabric here helps achieve the "overstuffed" look and feel for the bed. When the lining fabric stretches, the stuffing is then less constricted by it, and still has a chance to push directly against the outside of the bed. I'm pretty sure dogs like the "overstuffed" feel of the bed, too.

  I like it when the fabric has a woven-in or knitted-in striped or rectangular pattern, like the fabric I used in this case. It's a super helpful shortcut for measuring and cutting the right shape, since I can just cut along the stripe! Especially when I'm trying to cut out really big rectangular pieces in super stretchy fabric which is really hard to measure consistently as it stretches!

  **Purchasing tips and ideas**
      
</summary>
    
  My newest favorite place for finding random cheap fabrics is Walmart's "Value Fabrics" aisle. It's basically an assortment of fabric remnants at different length and price tiers. Depending on the fabrics, you get cuts of 2 yards for $4, 4 yards for $6, and 3 yards for $8. 

  The lining fabric I used for this bed was 4 yards for $6!

  You can order these online, but of course you'll just get a random selection which may or may not be worthwhile. So I prefer to actually go into a Walmart and see what I can find!

  I've also ordered "poly interlock lining fabric" online from both Walmart and Amazon at around $7-$8 for 3 yards. It works well, but it's only stretchy in one direction (also known as 2-way stretch, because of course jargon is more fun when it's counter-intuitive). So you have to be strategic about which direction you cut it in, especially for the donut part (you want it to stretch widthwise, not lengthwise).

  &#9313; About 3 yards of **fabric for the main bed surface**

  </summary>

  You can sometimes get away with 2 yards if you plan really carefully. I actually only had 2 yards of the fabric I used for this bed. I made it work but I had to do some creative tiling!
  
  I used a slightly-stretchy fabric for this particular dog bed, it's almost like a french terry but with two colors of yarn on the terry side (black and white). 
  
  After that experience, **I highly recommend using a non-stretchy fabric** for this part of the bed. Attaching the long separating zipper was a small nightmare, because the fabric really wanted to stretch out and get all wonky while I was sewing. I ended up applying liberal amounts of basting glue (in addition to the usual pins and fabric clips) before sewing.

  For other similar beds, I've used minky and/or fleece fabric. Actually, a lot of stuffed dog toys "minky swirl fabric" and I found that dogs really like that fabric on a dog bed, too.

  **Purchasing tips and ideas**
      
</summary>
    
  The fabric for this bed actually also came from Walmart's Value Fabric aisle. I think it's really cool fabric, I wish I knew how to find it and buy more of it! But like I mentioned, I probably wouldn't want to make another dog bed out of it because it's a stretchy knit fabric.

  I think non-stretchy "minky" type polyester fabrics are the way to go, dogs seem to love them.

  You can get "Minky swirl/rosette fabric" from Joann and sometimes Michael's. I've bought it from Joanne for another dog bed project and it was quite nice, but I would probably only buy it there when it's on sale. I found [a pretty inexpensive option at Big Z Fabrics](https://bigzfabric.com/collections/minky-rose-rosette-floral-baby-soft-fabric-hug-z-reg) - it seems like the same stuff from their pictures and videos. They also have other interesting "Minky" options to explore.

  Walmart has some pre-cut options they call "Minky Dot Fleece", "Plush Coral Fleece", "Chevron Fleece" and other similar names. I often see specific colors on sale online, but they tend to be full-price in store (though full-price is still pretty reasonable). These usually come pre-cut to 1.5 yards, so you'd have to get two, but that's perfectly workable. Maybe you could even go for two colors and make a colorblocked bed! Some of the varieties do have some stretch to them, though, so watch out for that.

  Finally, you can try looking for inexpensive minky/fleece throw blankets and cut them up to use as fabric. I think this is only cost-effective if you shop around aggressively and look for sales, though. For reference, I bought two 60" by 80" cow print blankets for $15 each on Amazon (I'm going to use them to make a cow bed for my cow print puppy!). That's roughly equivalent to 4 yards of fabric, depending on the width of the fabric you'd buy otherwise.

  &#9314; About 1 yard of **non-slip fabric for bottom of the bed**
  
  </summary>

  You can probably also just use the same fabric as you're using for the main bed surface, if you don't need it to be super non-slip and you're not worried about it getting super dirty from the floor.
  
  What you actually need is a piece a little bigger than 36" by 24", so if you buy a yard (which is 36") you may have a lot or a little left over, depending on the width of the fabric.

  I was going to use the orange textured fabric for this at first, because I was out of "real" non-slip fabric. But then I ended up buying the gray non-woven fabric in the second picture and used that.

  **Purchasing tips and ideas**
      
</summary>
    
Search for Non-slip and/or Grippy fabric.

It can be kind of expensive, and it's often quite narrow when you buy by the yard - make sure it's at least 24" wide!

Joann has "Cotton Grip Stop Wide Utility Fabric", but again, I would wait for it to be on sale.

I've also found cheaper grippy fabric on Walmart's online store (sold by third-party sellers and apparently shipped from China).

But for this project, I ended up using "Non-slip backing fabric for rugs". You can get it on Amazon for relatively cheap, if you shop around. It's a non-woven fabric and techincally you're not supposed to machine wash it, which would defeat the whole purpose of having removable cushions and a washable outer shell. But so far, it has survived at least one wash/dry cycle!

Search for "sleeping bag or tent separating zipper".

The best deal I found is by searching for "2 pcs separating tent zipper" on Walmart's online store. They are sold by a third-party seller (zipperstop). A nice bonus about these particular ones is that the slider is reversible, so I don't have to worry as much about accidentally sewing it on inside-out.

 This zipper will open up a separate compartment for the bottom cushion. It doesn't need to be a separating zipper because there are no donut complications. The zipper just opens up a hole and you take the cushion out through the hole.

You can get **huge** packs of 24-inch zippers on Amazon for pretty cheap. Or at least you used to be able to a while ago. And I've been going through them very slowly ever since that one time I needed a zipper but ended up buying like a 25-pack.

You can probably fit a lot more than 5 lbs of stuffing into these cushions, but 5 should be mostly enough. I think I used a little more for this particular bed.

Don't bother trying to search for "stuffing" or even "polyfill" unless you want turkey recipes or javascript nonsense. I think "fiber fill" is the best search term.

I bought a 20-lb box of stuffing (Poly-fil brand) since I was pretty sure I was going to be making a few of these! That seemed the most cost effective.

Another time, I was able to buy something called "Buffalo Snow Neige" when it was on deep, deep sale at Joann. It was $4 for 24 oz (which is actually only a bit cheaper per lb than $57 for 20 lbs of poly-fil)

It seems like Buffalo Snow might often be on sale like that, except maybe at Christmas when people actually use it for its intended purpose?

This goes on the bottom of the bottom cushion, and then I put some of the fiber fill on top.

I'm not sure how much of a difference the foam really makes, but I've seen how flat and condensed the fiber fill in a donut bed can get without any foam under it, so I decided to be fancy and have both foam and fiber fill.

It's consistently about $13 at Walmart and Joann; tends to be more expensive other places I found it (Michael's, Amazon)

It also doesn't seem to come in pieces much bigger than 24" by 36" (or I would make an even bigger dog bed!)

I think you do want high-density or "cushion" foam. Medium density would probably be even less noticeable and useful under all that stuffing.

One could argue that the puppy is not a *material*, per se. But he really really tried hard to integrate himself into the bed throughout the process.

One could also argue that a dog or puppy is not strictly optional, if you're making a dog bed. What's optional is how involved the dog is in the making process.

So, what I did was:

1. Start "temporarily" fostering a mama dog and her four 1-week-old puppies
2. Keep fostering them all until the puppies were completely weaned and ready to be adopted
3. Adopt the puppy that was my adult dog's clear favorite, and name him Cow Boy (because he's a boy who is a cow, obviously)

If you don't want to do all that, you could also [adopt Cow Boy's mom](https://www.shelterluv.com/embed/animal/66058274), whom I'm still fostering after more than a year!

Or adopt any dog - shelters are overflowing with them!

For this bed, I ended up using some white fabric for the face and feet, scraps of black fabric for the eyes, and scraps of red fabric for the mouth.

I also used something that I'm pretty sure is called "3D mesh spacer fabric" inside the ear edges to keep the ears from being too floppy. I think it's similar to, but different from, "foam stabilizer" fabrics that people use to make fabric baskets and other things that need to hold their shape.

Round the corners to get approximately this shape:

<img src="assets/images/cushions/bottom/PXL_20240208_164512239.jpg" height="300"/>

I like to cut off one corner first, then use it to mark the other corners, both on the foam cushion and (later on) on the fabric that's going to go around it.

<img src="assets/images/cushions/bottom/PXL_20240208_164152155.jpg" height="300"/>

<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="1">Nerdy details on how I got this particular corner shape   
</summary>

Because I was worried about conserving the main bed surface fabric, I wanted to ensure that the total perimeter of the cushion would be around 100". That way, the donut perimeter/length could also be 100", and I was pretty sure that I could make that work.

The perimeter of a 24" x 36" rectangle of foam is `(24+36)*2 = 120`. So I needed to lose a total of 20", or 5" per corner.

Let's consider a square, and a circle that's inscribed inside the square. Essentially, this circle is what would happen if we rounded the square's corners "all the way". 

If the square's side length is `L`, then its perimeter is `4*L`. The circle's perimeter (also known as circumference) is `π*L`, but we can approximate π to be 3 - it's close enough, considering the general imprecision of working with fabric.

So the perimeter of the circle is about 3/4 of the perimeter of the square. In other words, when we round corners "all the way down" using a roughly circular shape, we reduce the length by 1/4.

So if I need to reduce a corner by 5", the bit of the corner that I'm rounding should have a total length of 20". 

And then I can cut off a roughly circular shape, to make the reduced length of the curved circular bit roughly 15".

So I measured out a total of 20" along the corner, with 8" on the shorter side and 12" on the longer side.

<img src="assets/images/cushions/bottom/measuring/PXL_20240208_162421658.jpg" height="300"/>

You may notice that 8 is not equal to 12, so now it would be difficult to draw an actual (non-stretched-out) circle on that corner. Again, that kind of precision doesn't matter a whole lot when working with things that are squishy and stretchy and imprecise. We can just fudge the exact shape of the corner so it's the right length. But the math ensures that we are very close by the time we start fudging.

You can see that I got pretty close to 15" on the curved corner bit:

<img src="assets/images/cushions/bottom/measuring/PXL_20240208_163412978.jpg" height="300"/>

And the total perimeter also ended up quite close to the 100" I was going for:

</details>

Try not to let your puppy destroy your canonical foam corner until you're done making the bed. But if he does, you do have three back-ups!

<img src="assets/images/cushions/bottom/PXL_20240208_191343829.jpg" height="300"/>

Convince your puppy and his best friend to get off your lining fabric.

<img src="assets/images/cushions/bottom/PXL_20240208_173515523.jpg" height="300"/>

Cut out a piece of lining fabric that's 36" by 48" (so twice as wide as the cushion will be). Fold it in half, and use the foam corner that your puppy didn't destroy to mark and pin where you will sew the two halves together.

<details>
<summary> Shouldn't I make it a little bigger?</summary>

It might make sense to add an inch or two to the dimensions of this piece, to account for both the thickness of the foam and potential additional surface area that will come from the stuffing. However, I usually don't bother, especially when the fabric I'm working with is so stretchy.
  
</details>

<img src="assets/images/cushions/bottom/PXL_20240208_175923119.jpg" height="400"/>

Sew it together, leaving a gap that's big enough to insert the foam cushion through (probably bigger than the one I left). Then cut off the corners so they don't get in the way and make things lumpy

<img src="assets/images/cushions/bottom/PXL_20240208_234608792.MP.jpg" height="400"/>

Tip: If your puppy managed to leave a really stinky stain on the fabric piece before you even started sewing, now is a good time to give it a wash, before you start stuffing. Or you could go out of order and sew all the lining fabric pieces together before doing any stuffing, and wash them all together. Especially if you think that none of them will come out of the creation process particularly clean.

<img src="assets/images/cushions/bottom/PXL_20240208_171413445.jpg" height="400"/>
<img src="assets/images/cushions/bottom/PXL_20240208_171421029.jpg" height="400"/>

OK, now turn the fabric inside out through the gap, so the stitching is on the inside. Insert the foam cushion, and then stuff lots of stuffing on top of the foam.

<img src="assets/images/cushions/bottom/PXL_20240210_164852430.jpg" height="300"/>

Invite your canine testing team to test whether you've put in enough stuffing

At some point, when you're satisfied with the amount of stuffing, you should sew the cushion closed. I didn't actually do this to any of the cushions until the very end, though. That way I could adjust the stuffing as I tested the bed throughout the process.

</summary>

Cut out a piece of the lining fabric that's 24" wide and *about* 100-120 inches long. The actual length should be the same as the perimeter of your foam cushion, which will depend on how exactly you rounded the corners on the foam. 

<img src="assets/images/cushions/donut/PXL_20240208_182323281.jpg" height="400"/>

Pin and sew the two long sides together.

Now you have a really long tube. Pull one end of the tube through the tube toward the other end. 

<details>
<summary>
  But that doesn't look like a donut!
</summary>
  
This shape may seem weird, since this doesn't make the right kind of donut. However, it will become right once we turn it inside out after sewing. Or rather, we will turn it *right* side out so that all the seams are facing the inside. So yes, by the way, you should probably have been folding and sewing all that stuff with the right-sides facing each other. 

But also none of that matters a whole lot, since these cushions won't really be visible in day-to-day use.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
  Be careful not to twist it (maybe)
</summary>

It's pretty easy to accidentally twist the fabric a full turn while you're pulling it through if you're just lining up the seam with itself at the end. Though if you do accidentally twist it, it doesn't actually make a huge difference in the final shape of the bed. It just looks a bit weird if you look closely enough.

</details>

Stuff the donut! I was glad that I left the hole open after stuffing this one, because I ended up putting it a lot more stuffing once I saw how it looks in the bed.

</summary>

The head shape works a lot like a baseball shape - two long pieces sewn together to make a sphere - but a bit simpler than an actual baseball shape.

First, cut out two pieces that are 36" long and 12" wide, with  both ends completely rounded into circles. (The circles will have a a radius of 6"/diameter of 12", i.e. the full width of the piece.)

<img src="assets/images/cushions/head/PXL_20240208_201914939.jpg" height="400"/>

Before trying to attach the two pieces together, I find it helpful to mark the four major points on each piece: the top/bottom ends of the circles, and the middle of each side.

To start putting the pieces together, put one piece on top of the other in a T-shape, with the "end" of one piece against the "middle" of the other.

<img src="assets/images/cushions/head/PXL_20240208_202017410.jpg" height="400"/>

Starting at that meeting point at the top of the T, go around and pin the two pieces together.

<img src="assets/images/cushions/head/PXL_20240208_202551154.jpg" height="300"/>

Pin all the way around and sew together (but leave some of the seam open so we can turn it inside out and stuff it!). It may actually be easier to pin and sew one quarter at a time, instead of trying to pin the whole sphere shape together at once.

<img src="assets/images/cushions/head/PXL_20240208_214007773.jpg" height="400"/>

Turn your deflated baseball dohickey inside out. Now you can stuff it to make a sphere! (but you may actually want to hold off on that until you make the face/snout part)

#### The face

</summary>

Now it's time to decide what kind of animal you're making, and what kind of face/snout it will need. The outer fabric I chose reminded me of a sock monkey, so I went with a monkey design for this one. I've also made a pig and a sheep before, and their snouts were pretty different.

In an actual sock monkey, the mouth is made from the heel of one of the socks. The heel has a relatively simple shape:

<img src="assets/images/cushions/head/PXL_20240211_194458379.jpg" height="300"/>

In particular, we can note that:

- The heel's width is half of the sock's entire perimeter (for us, that's 12" * 2 = 24")
- The height is about 1/4 of the width
- The sides are angled at about 45 degrees

So I drew out the appropriate shape on my lining fabric (the chalk was kind of faint, so I added dotted lines in the picture on top of the chalk outline):

<img src="assets/images/cushions/head/PXL_20240211_190655436.jpg" height="300"/>

However, since I'm not constrained by actually making my monkey out of a sock, I also rounded the diagonals before cutting it out and sewing it together:

I sketched out where the mouth will go on the head sphere:

<summary  markdown="1"> Even more nerdy details on how exactly I decided where the mouth should go 
</summary>

First, I usually arrange the head "sphere" so that one of the baseball pieces ends up being the bottom and two sides, and the other piece is the top and front/back.

I decided that I want the bottom of the mouth to just touch the intersection between the two pieces; and also I wanted the height of the mouth (along the sphere) to be about 8.5 inches.

<img src="assets/images/cushions/head/face-height.jpg" height="300"/>

Why 8.5 inches? I'm glad you asked. The "height" of the mouth piece is 6" (1/4 of the width, based on the sock heel model). When the sock is on a foot, and the heel is actually making a 3-dimensional heel, it makes a 90 degree angle. Thus, the distance between the top and bottom edges of the heel piece is the hypotenuse of a right triangle, so it's 6" times the square root of 2, or about 8.5".

Now, recall that the width of our mouth is exactly half of the total perimeter of our sphere, by design. The simplest way to fit that on our sphere, given our other constraints, is to make the edges of the mouth be geodesic arcs (so like longitude on a globe, but not like latitude) that go from one "pole" to the other "pole", if we put the axis through the side of our sphere

<img src="assets/images/cushions/head/face-globe.jpg" height="400"/>

Note: my poles ended up being an inch or so lower than the centers of the circles which make up the rounded ends on the sides. This may or may not be counterintuitive, depending on what approximation we're using to treat our head shape as a sphere. In particular, consider the fact that if you actually drew out the four circles and/or drew the horizontal lines across where the rounded bits begin, they would be offset and would **not** line up perfectly.

Now I just needed to sew the mouth on. I kept the mouth as a separate "compartment" with its own stuffing. If I had cut out the part of the head that went "underneath" the mouth, and stuffed everything together, the head would just become one roughly-spherical blob again instead of having a well-defined "snout" attached to a well-defined head.

### Step 1. The main bed surface and sides

</summary>

First, we'll make the actual bed surface and the sides which will eventually turn into the donut. We'll also attach the bottom side of the long separating zipper.

Take out the fabric you're using for the main bed, and convince your dogs to get off of it so you can make their bed.

<img src="assets/images/shell/surface-sides/PXL_20240208_225110695.MP.jpg" height="400"/>

Cut out a piece of fabric that's the same dimensions as your bottom cushion (about 36" by 24 " with rounded corners). 

<details markdown="1">
<summary markdown="1"> Should I make the outer pieces slightly bigger?
</summary>
  
If you want, you could add a couple of inches to the overall dimensions to account for the fact that you've stuffed a lot of stuffing into the cushion. I sometimes measure the actual cushion to see how "fat" it's gotten both width-wise and length-wise. But in that case I still subtract an inch or two from each dimension, because I don't want the cushion to be loose in there; I actually want it to be somewhat squished and make the bed look and feel overstuffed.

In this case, I ended up adding a couple of inches to the width, because that's what I could fit into my plan for the 2 yards of fabric I had. So this piece is actually 26" by 36".

Interestingly, when I was cutting out the bottom (non-slip) piece, it ended up being more convenient to add a couple of inches to the length. So that piece was 24" by 38" - same perimeter as the top piece, but different shape. This does make the final shape of the bed a bit non-flat. Notably, the back and front of the bed tend to rise up a little bit. But it's not super critical and the couple of inches don't make a huge difference on this scale of things.

Convince your dogs to get off your fabric **again**.

<img src="assets/images/shell/surface-sides/PXL_20240208_233948141.MP.jpg" height="300"/>

Cut out a looong rectangular piece the same shape as the fabric you used for the donut cushion (so 24" by somewhere between 100-120"). Or you can do what I did and cut out two pieces that add up to that length.

<img src="assets/images/shell/surface-sides/PXL_20240208_231355194.jpg" height="400"/>

Pin and sew the short sides together so it makes a large circle or tube (depending on your perspective).

<img src="assets/images/shell/surface-sides/PXL_20240208_233125061.jpg" height="400"/>

Now we attach together the surface, the sides, and the long separating zipper. This is one of the tricky and potentially confusing parts.

<img src="assets/images/shell/surface-sides/PXL_20240209_024745818.jpg" height="300"/>

Pin one edge of the tube along the edge of the bed surface piece, with the "right" sides facing each other and the "wrong" sides facing out. The zipper then goes on top of the tube piece, along the edge. It goes on the wrong side of the tube, but the zipper should be **right** side up (with the zipper pull facing out). If you got a zipper with a reversible slider, that's one less thing to get wrong, since both sides of the zipper are the right side!

I usually pin the two fabric pieces together first, then go around and pin the zipper on top, removing the original pins as I put new ones in that hold together all 3 layers. If I'm using stretchy fabric, I also use a heck of a lot of basting glue when I'm pinning the zipper on.

This is what the zipper ends will look like after you sew everything together:

<img src="assets/images/shell/surface-sides/PXL_20240210_180018611.jpg" height="400"/>

Notice that the end with the zipper pull is right up against the edge, and the other end (with the separating part) slips behind it, a little bit higher on the tube fabric.

And here is what it'll look like once it's all sewn together:

### Step 2. The non-slip bottom

<img src="assets/images/shell/bottom/PXL_20240211_022705727.jpg" height="300"/>

</summary>

Now we can make the non-slip bottom. It actually gets sewn on right over the seam we just made in the previous step. So if you're really ambitious, you could try combining the two steps and sewing all 4 things together at once. I've never attempted this because I'm pretty sure I would immediately make a huge mess and everything would fall apart.

Cut out a piece of the non-slip fabric that's the same dimensions as your bed surface piece (so 36" by 24" or a bit bigger, with rounded corners).

<img src="assets/images/shell/bottom/PXL_20240210_172923366.MP.jpg" height="300"/>

Pin it to the bed we have so far so that **everything that should be on the outside is on the inside**: 

- the "right" side of the bed surface and the zipper should be facing up
- the sides/donut part of the bed are all tucked in inside
- the non-slip bottom piece should be with the non-slip part facing down.

This seems really weird, but we'll be turing it right-side out after we sew it on.

<img src="assets/images/shell/bottom/PXL_20240210_182529518.jpg" height="300"/>
<img src="assets/images/shell/bottom/PXL_20240210_182546770.jpg" height="300"/>

Sew it in place, **but leave one end open for the zipper**.

Then sew on the zipper in the usual way, with one side of the zipper attached to each of the pieces. Make sure that the zipper pull is facing inward. You may also want to make sure the zipper is partially unzipped before you finish sewing everything together, otherwise it'll be a real pain to unzip and turn everything right-side out.

<img src="assets/images/shell/bottom/PXL_20240211_020637151.MP.jpg" height="300"/>

It should look something like this when you're done:

<img src="assets/images/shell/bottom/PXL_20240211_022558732.jpg" height="400"/>

Explain to your puppy that it's not "too small", it's just not ready for use yet.

<img src="assets/images/shell/bottom/PXL_20240211_022528577.MP.jpg" height="400"/>

You can now turn it right-side out through the zipper you just attached. The bottom part of the bed is now ready to hold the bottom cushion!

<img src="assets/images/shell/bottom/PXL_20240211_022705727.jpg" height="300"/>
<img src="assets/images/shell/bottom/PXL_20240211_023001193.MP.jpg" height="300"/>

You can even try draping the side fabric over the donut cushion to get the approximate bed shape. Your puppy should now be slighyly less concerned.
